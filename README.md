# Pong AI

This project has an AI which learns to play the game Pong. It's a python script that runs the game and teaches an AI to play it using reinforcement learning, specifically the NEAT algorithm. The AI plays against itself for a number of generations or until it gets good at the game.

This one does not have a video.
